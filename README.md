# Frankencoin Grant Program

## Overview
The **Frankencoin Grant Program (FGP)** is an initiative by the Frankencoin Association to support builders who contribute to the growth and innovation of the Frankencoin ecosystem. Grants are awarded at the discretion of the association’s board to fund projects that enhance usability, security, and adoption of Frankencoin.

## How to Apply
Grant applications follow a structured process to ensure transparency and efficiency:

1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Create a Frankencoin Grant Proposal (FGP)** following the [FGP Template](<./FGP-00: Template/FGP-00.md>)
3. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)** with your proposal
4. **Review & Discussion** – The Frankencoin Association Board will review, provide feedback, and discuss the application
5. **Decision & Funding** – If approved, grants will be awarded based on agreed milestones

## Evaluation Criteria
The board evaluates proposals based on:
- **Value to the Frankencoin Ecosystem** – Does it enhance usability, security, or adoption?
- **Feasibility** – Is the project realistically implementable?
- **Innovation** – Does the project introduce new use cases?
- **Technical Soundness** – Is the project well-structured and technically viable?
- **Sustainability** – Can the project sustain itself post-grant?

- **Alternative Frontends** – Web-based/mobile interfaces for Frankencoin
